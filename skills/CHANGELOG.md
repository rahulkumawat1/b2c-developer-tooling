# @salesforce/b2c-agent-plugins

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#494](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/494) [`f630103`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/f630103e4c55fbdf68896db2f870851efe390ac1) - Update the b2c-cip agent skill to cover the new technical/developer CIP reports (SCAPI/OCAPI/controller latency, error-rate, and cache analytics) and the `b2c cip report list` discovery command. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#489](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/489) [`0b19efe`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/0b19efec7d361ae0a5c226fc71d66368c3a3e1aa) - Add Storefront Next design-system skills and a new `storefront-next-figma` plugin. (Thanks [@pav-ui](https://github.com/pav-ui)!)
  - New `sfnext-create-vertical` skill (storefront-next): create a brand theme / storefront variant through the brand token layer, with typography, dark-mode contrast checks, fixture-based local development, and the extension-vs-base decision.
  - New `sfnext-create-component` skill (storefront-next): design-system component authoring — layer model, extend-before-create gate, CVA variants bound to semantic tokens, `data-slot`, accessibility, and Storybook coverage (complements `sfnext-components`).
  - Enhanced `sfnext-extensions` skill with a base-audit decision gate (deciding whether to extend at all vs a token/variant override or a base slot) plus a `BASE-AUDIT.md` reference.
  - New `storefront-next-figma` plugin with the `sfnext-create-figma-kit` skill: duplicate the Figma kit for a vertical, sync Brand variables from `brand.css`, edit components at the correct layer, and publish Code Connect. Requires the Figma MCP server.

  Together these add the design-system / theming / Figma layer that the existing `storefront-next` plugin did not cover.

### Patch Changes

- [`0c9eeab`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/0c9eeab3aae624eb8e834e81620b0bc82e3356f3) - Release packaging now reads the list of agent plugins from `skills/plugins.json`. To publish a new plugin, add its `skills/<name>/` directory and list its name in that manifest — no changes to the publish workflow are required. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [`aa48c8e`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/aa48c8e441cb5c85eb94d9d63bb0d92d0e68baf0) - Fix the Business Manager extensions skill (`b2c-business-manager-extensions`) to match the authoritative `bmext.xsd` schema. The previous guidance used the wrong namespace and element shapes (resource-key `name`/`icon` attributes, `xp-ref`, a `bm_extensions.properties` bundle) that would not load on a real instance. The skill now documents the `bmmodules/2007-12-11` schema with inline localized `name`/`description` elements, correct `dialogaction`/`formextension` structures, the `NoPermissionCheck` idiom for permission-free endpoints, ascending `position` ordering, and the core BM menu-id table for attaching to existing menus. All XML examples validate against the schema. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#493](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/493) [`e803346`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/e8033465e50d57dd7d87afa400d8caadb82280aa) - Skills now consistently document that the CLI auto-discovers configuration (instance, credentials, tenantId, etc.) from `dw.json`, `SFCC_*` env vars, `~/.mobify`, and `package.json` — flags like `--server`, `--client-id`, and `--client-secret` are usually unnecessary. Each instance-touching skill points agents at `b2c setup inspect` for resolved values and sources, and back to `b2c-config` for setup troubleshooting. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  The `b2c-config` skill has been broadened to be the fallback whenever CLI setup or authentication is unclear, with general configuration guidance (including the fact that `dw.json` keys accept both camelCase and kebab-case) and a richer troubleshooting section.

  The `b2c-custom-api-development` skill now describes Custom API cartridge-path lookup correctly: storefront `siteId` resolves through that site's cartridge path, while `siteId=Sites-Site` (the system-defined BM/organization site identifier) and an omitted `siteId` resolve through the Business Manager cartridge path. The skill shows how to manage paths with `b2c sites cartridges` and clarifies when `b2c code deploy --reload` is required (registration, contract, or cartridge-path changes) versus when a plain redeploy suffices (implementation-only edits to an already-registered endpoint).

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [#485](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/485) [`e6cec0a`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/e6cec0a704c65d9f0241fa9771fed37017eb7b1a) - Fix `value-definition` element order in the b2c-metadata and b2c-site-import-export skills. The B2C `metadata.xsd` requires `<display>` to appear before `<value>` inside each `<value-definition>`; the skill examples had them reversed, which caused enum/set attribute imports to fail site-archive validation with `cvc-complex-type.2.4.d`. Examples now use the correct order and call out the requirement. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#484](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/484) [`80e63fc`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/80e63fca888d9b83efd53c9c0054247fb2aa31b3) - `b2c job import` now supports `--split` for importing directories larger than the instance archive size limit. With `--split` (and optional `--max-size`, default `190mb`), the import is broken into several smaller archives: order-sensitive metadata/XML is imported first — kept together when it fits, otherwise split at data-unit boundaries in dependency order — followed by static assets packed by compressed size. A normal import that exceeds the limit now warns and recommends `--split`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Example: `b2c job import ./big-site-data --split --max-size 150mb`

  The SDK adds a corresponding `siteArchiveImportSplit()` operation.

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#428](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/428) [`db7b330`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/db7b330cf60debf05d681b9e1dbb4e025d8eec02) - `b2c job import` now accepts an optional list of paths or globs after the directory `TARGET`, allowing you to import a subset of a site export. Paths are resolved literally first (so shell-expanded globs work) and fall back to root-relative or internal glob expansion when the literal path doesn't exist. The archive preserves each path's layout under `TARGET`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

  Example: `b2c job import ./my-site-data sites/RefArch libraries/mylib`

  The SDK's `siteArchiveImport` operation gains a corresponding `paths` option for directory targets.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`ac0da1b`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/ac0da1b42699613e6d7c22503676641df3a31201) - Exclude per-skill `evals/` directories from the released skills zip artifacts so end users don't receive eval fixtures. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#408](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/408) [`a26226c`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/a26226c8d755bc3d93462418cb94ddc0f1083a29) - Added a new `b2c-bm-users-roles` skill covering all `b2c bm` instance commands — `bm roles`, `bm users`, `bm whoami`, and `bm access-key`. The existing `b2c-am` skill now defers to it for Business Manager content and stays focused on Account Manager (cross-instance) administration. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

(Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#394](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/394) [`5ae3691`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/5ae369114e33f8b24d54f0c233dd71d50fbb92d4) - Improve skill trigger accuracy: rewrite b2c-scapi-admin and b2c-site-import-export descriptions, merge b2c-users-roles into b2c-am, fix weak eval prompts for b2c-job (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

- [#405](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/405) [`b1600fa`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/b1600fa014f9bd23c93488155b37ac2cc5c91fd2) - Document new MRT environment clone, bundle delete, organization member, and organization certificate commands in the `b2c-mrt` skill. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#365](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/pull/365) [`c4309db`](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/b2c-developer-tooling/commit/c4309db94c8c61b25692775557c6c9ab0f627859) - Initial release. This package tracks the version of the B2C Commerce agent skills plugins (`b2c-cli` and `b2c`). Its version is stamped into the Claude Code marketplace entries and the Codex plugin manifests at release time, and skills-only changes get a dedicated `b2c-agent-plugins@X.Y.Z` GitHub release tag with updated skills zips attached. Target this package in a changeset when you change skills under `skills/b2c-cli/skills/` or `skills/b2c/skills/`. (Thanks [@clavery](https://github.com/clavery)!)
